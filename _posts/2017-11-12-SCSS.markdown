Making this blog i used the static site generator jekyll. Jekyll were problematic for me at first cause I didn't know how to work with it. It took me some time to under stand how it worked.
When I understood the basics there wasn't many problems, it's very easy to work with and all the basics were there for you to work with. There were alot of themes you could work with and you even got a starter theme that I thought were wery nice.

Static site generators are great for blogs like mine where you get the basics to work with. They fit in perfect with those types of web pages were you only need basics and not anything special. They save alot of time for the person needing a basic site.
