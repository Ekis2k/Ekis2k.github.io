Elias Ekman.

That name you just read is mine and I am an webbproggramming campus-student at LNU. LNU has so far been an great experience so far and I truly hope it stays that way.
I've learnt so much during my not so long stay here in Kalmar and I enjoy it so far. The city Kalmar has been great to me, I live in a great studentapartment that fit my needs and it's not too big or small like my hometown Alings√•s.

My favorite things to do is mostly have fun with friends and sports. Me and my friends often play games online and IRL. Sportswise i've played football the most part of my life but I do enjoy all kinds of sport.
